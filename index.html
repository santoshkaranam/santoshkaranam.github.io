2 What is the LACO-Wiki Online Tool?
LACO-Wiki provides a software framework which serves as a single online access point for the map
validation process.
It guides the user through the set-up of all necessary input data and the entire validation process.
LACO-Wiki enables the user to set-up methodologically sound sampling designs and the convenient
interpretation of samples in a user-friendly environment.
It also allows the user to easily generate state-of-the-art accuracy reports ready for communication
to map users.
Hence, the tool also includes data management and sharing functionality so that every data uploaded
or generated in LACO-Wiki can be managed by the owner and shared with other users which could
provide a valuable resource for building improved hybrid land cover maps.
Features:
 LACO-Wiki offers a single online access point for the complete map validation process.
 A user-friendly environment to upload new maps and create sampling designs.
 State-of-the-art accuracy reports generated with just a few clicks.
 Easy access to shared datasets and validations sessions, allowing users to share the workload
with other people in their team and have multiple people validate datasets at once.

3 The Validation Process from Start to Finish
The following chapter guides you through a quick example of a complete validation session – from
login to generating the final report.
3.1 Login
LACO-Wiki currently supports three different login options:
- An existing Geo-Wiki account,
- your Facebook login or
- your Google account.
Use of the offered options to create your account and get started using LACO-Wiki right away.
LACO-Wiki may ask you to access your email address and public profile in order to create your
account.

Figure 2: Click "Upload" to start creating your first dataset.
You will be forwarded to the “Create a new Dataset” screen. Here you can specify your new dataset
and enter your dataset information like name, land cover type and description.
LACO-Wiki currently supports three different land cover types for your dataset:
- Categorical
- Continuous
- Background
Categorical
Categorical data, also called thematic, discrete, or classified data, are used both for vector and
raster data to represent discrete information. Examples of categorical data are land cover or land
use maps like pan-European CORINE land cover, Urban Atlas or regional LISA Land Cover as well
as global CCI Land Cover, GlobCover etc.
Continuous
Continuous data, representing phenomena such as percentage, elevation data or density such as
the Copernicus high resolution layers of imperviousness degree and forest density or population
(density) maps.
Background
Background layers can be used additionally to Google and Bing maps base imagery in the
validation step. Examples of such datasets would be an orthophoto of the study area.

Figure 3: Enter your dataset information.
The final step in creating your new dataset is adding shape files or GeoTiffs to the dataset. Currently
the following file types are supported:
- Supported file types: Shape (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj), GeoTiff (.tif, .tiff)
- Supported SRS: WGS84 or ETRS89 LAEA
Add your files to the dataset by clicking the “Select Files” button and manually selecting them on your
file browser or simply drag-and-dropping them into the marked area.

Once you are satisfied with your selection, hit “Save” and return to the “Dataset Details” screen.
3.4 Sample
The next step in the process is creating a sample collection based on your new dataset.
To do that you have to click the button in the “Validation Samples” section on the “Dataset Details”
screen.
This will forward you to the “Create a new Sample Collection” page.
Add name and description to your new sample collection.
Then add different sampling methods to the collection. Depending on your dataset’s land cover type
and the uploaded data type (vector or raster file) different sampling methods will be available.
Currently the following sampling methods are supported:
- Random Point
- Random Pixel
LACO-Wiki – An open access online portal for land cover validation
QUICK START GUIDE
LACO-WIKI – WORKFLOW PAGE 11 OF 20
- Random Polygon
- Polygon at Random Point
- Stratified Random Point
- Stratified Random Pixel
- Stratified Random Polygon
Random Point
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of points, which will be randomly
distributed over the reference dataset.
Random Pixel
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of pixels which will be randomly
selected from the reference dataset. Duplicates are not possible.
Random Polygon
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of polygons which will be
randomly selected from the reference dataset. Duplicates are not possible.
Polygon at Random Point
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of polygons, which will be
randomly selected from the reference dataset, whereby the probability for selection will be
influenced by the size of the polygons (i.e. higher probability of large polygons to be selected).
Duplicates are not possible.
Stratified Random Point
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of points per class (e.g. land
cover), which will be randomly distributed over the specified classes of the reference dataset.
Stratified Random Pixel
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of pixels per class (e.g. land
cover), which will be randomly selected from the specified classes of the reference dataset.
Stratified Random Polygon
This approach creates a sample dataset with a definable number of polygons per class (e.g. land
cover), which will be randomly selected from the specified classes of the reference dataset.

Figure 8: Create your Validation exercise.
Again, enter your name and description for your validation session and choose a validation method.
The following validation methods are currently supported:
- Blind
- Plausibility
Blind
The user has no information about the classification of the sample and therefore needs to provide a
new interpretation based on a pre-defined list of classes.
Plausibility
The user has information about the classification of the sample and evaluates the plausibility of the
thematic classification with yes or no.

LACO-WIKI – WORKFLOW PAGE 14 OF 20
You can also choose your validation platform. There are two supported validation platforms available:
- Web
- Mobile
Web
The validation process will be carried out inside a web browser and using a variable number of
base imagery datasets.
Mobile
The validation process will be carried out using the LACO-Wiki mobile smartphone app in-situ.
For the web version there are additional validation settings and layer configurations available. You can
set minimum and maximum zoom level, sample navigation (feature extend or fixed zoom level) and
define base layers and overlays.
Figure 9: Configure your validation settings and layer configuration.
When you are ready you can click “Create Validation Session” to start validating your sample
collection of the new dataset.

The process of validating all your samples can be paused and continued at any time.
LACO-Wiki also allows you to split the workload by sharing the current validation session with other
users and let them continue validating your dataset.
Figure 10: Details page of the validation session that has been created
Depending on the validation session settings, the validation page will display the sample that should
be validated displayed in a map with base imagery and additional layers that are accessible using the
layer switcher control. The actual validation is done by classifying the object using one of the legend
items in case of a blind validation, or just selecting correct or incorrect for the given classification of the
object in case of a plausibility validation.

Give it a name and specify a description.
You can select from different pre-defined styles.
Next, check the check boxes for the statistical values you want to add to the report.
Currently the following values are supported:
- User Accuracy
- Producer Accuracy
- Overall Accuracy
- Average Mutual Information
- Quantity Disagreement
LACO-Wiki – An open access online portal for land cover validation
QUICK START GUIDE
LACO-WIKI – WORKFLOW PAGE 18 OF 20
- Allocation Disagreement
- Kappa
- Portmanteau Accuracy
User Accuracy
The user accuracy presents the reliability of classes in the classified image: it is the fraction of
correctly classified pixels with regard to all pixels selected as a given class.
Producer Accuracy
The producer accuracy presents the accuracy of your classification: it is the fraction of correctly
classified pixels with regard to all pixels of a given ground truth class.
Overall Accuracy
The overall accuracy is calculated as the total number of correctly classified pixels (diagonal
elements) divided by the total number of test pixels.
Average Mutual Information
The average mutual information is measuring the dependence between two variables. AMI
provides a means of assessing the similarity of maps with different themes, i.e. the amount of
information that one map predicts of the other (Finn, 1993, Foody, 2006)
Quantity Disagreement
The amount of difference between the reference map and a comparison map that is due to the less
than perfect match in the proportions of the categories. (Pontius and Millones, 2011)
Allocation Disagreement
The amount of difference between the reference map and a comparison map that is due to the less
than optimal match in the spatial allocation of the categories, given the proportions of the
categories in the reference and comparison maps. (Pontius and Millones, 2011)
Kappa
Cohen's kappa coefficient is a statistic which measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative
(categorical) items. It is generally thought to be a more robust measure than simple percent
agreement calculation, since kappa takes into account the agreement occurring by chance.
Portmanteau Accuracy
The portmanteau accuracy describes the overall accuracy when the data are collapsed to two
classes, the land cover type of interest, and all other land cover types combined into a single class.
Afterwards you can generate your report by clicking “Create Report”.
Download the report in Excel format.
